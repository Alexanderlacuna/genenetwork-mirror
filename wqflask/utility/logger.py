# GeneNetwork logger
#
# The standard python logging module is very good. This logger adds a
# few facilities on top of that. Main one being that it picks up
# settings for log levels (global and by module) and (potentially)
# offers some fine grained log levels for the standard levels.
#
# Global settings (defined in default_settings.py).
